# noobWebMaster

Basic responsive webpage design to add one more skill to my CV

## Setup

Use git to clone the repository to any folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VrutikShah/noobWebMaster
```

## Usage
Unzip the folder to any location. Then run index.html in any browser (Google Chrome preferred)



## Required files
All the necessary bootstrap and js files are already included under `css/` and `js/` folders. 

`css/style.css` contains all the custom styles used for this project.

`assets/` folder has the media files displayed on the page.

No additional setup required. Just have an active internet connection since the page loads some files during runtime.

## Extra 
1. The page is responsive and can be tested at different screen sizes and devices (use Chrome's `Inspect` feature)
2. Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
3. Look out for a couple of Easter eggs
