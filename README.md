# noobWebMaster

Basic responsive webpage design to add one more skill to my CV

## Setup

Use git to clone the repository to any folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VrutikShah/noobWebMaster
```

## Usage
Unzip the folder to any location. Then run index.html in any browser (Google Chrome preferred)



## Required files
All the bootstrap and js files are already included in the folder. No additional setup required. Just have an active internet connection since the page loads some files during runtime.

`./css/style.css` contains all the custom styles used for this project.

## Extra 
1. The page is responsive and can be tested at different screen sizes and devices (use Chrome's `Inspect` feature)
2. Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change
3. Look out for a couple of Easter eggs
